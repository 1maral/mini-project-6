Overview:

This project implements a more complex Abstract Data Type for a two-dimensional array, or known as a matrix,
using a generic two-dimensional array T[][]. I chose to implement matrices as arrays of arrays, rather than
using single arrays or associative arrays, to maintain clarity and flexibility in managing the elements.
It provides a variety of methods to manipulate matrices, including basic operations like retrieving and
setting elements, resizing the matrix by adding or removing rows and columns, and filling specific regions
or lines within the matrix. Lastly, the project ensures that matrix dimensions and index boundaries are handled
with exceptions.
